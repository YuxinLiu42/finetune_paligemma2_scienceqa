## Group information

### Question 2
> **Enter the study number for each member in the group**
>
> Answer:
Duc-Anh Nguyen 12433139
Yuxin Liu




## Coding environment
> In the following section we are interested in learning more about your local development environment.

### Question 3
> **What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
> Answer:
We, as a team, successfully developed an image classifier that can accurately classify different varieties of rice. The classifier is able to distinguish between Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag rice. 

To create the classifier, we utilized a deep learning model and utilized the PyTorch Images framework (Timm) to import a pre-trained ResNet50 model and a training script. We imported a large dataset of rice images from Kaggle.com to train our model. 

We found that by utilizing a deep learning model and a large dataset, we were able to achieve a high level of accuracy in classifying the different varieties of rice. Additionally, our pipeline involved using W&B, GCP, and GitHub for tracking our progress, storing our data, and deploying our model. Overall, this project was a great success and using TIMM made it easier to deploy the model and helped us put more focus on our pipeline.



########
In this project we utilized the [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) repository from the Huggingface group. This repository provides the [t5-small model](https://huggingface.co/t5-small), which is a natural language processing (NLP) model that can translate text from one language to another.

In this project we have used the Trainer class in the pytorch lightning framework to train and test the t5-small model on a subset of the english/ german (en-de) subset of the [WMT19 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wmt19) (from the fourth conference on machine translation).

We have used Weights and biases (`wandb`) to both handle the configuration file with the hyperparameters for the model and for logging the training and validation loss.










### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development enviroment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:
>
> Construct one or multiple docker files for your code (M10)
Build the docker files locally and make sure they work as intended (M10)

Packages are mananged in conda environments. The packages required can be found in the requirements.txt file which is placed in the top folder in the cookiecutter structure. In this txt file we have a complete list of all used packages and relevant versions in this project. The requirement.txt file was auto-generated using the command pipreqs. To get a complete copy of our development enviroment, one would have to run the following commands (assuming they have git and Python 3.10 installed):
```
git clone https://github.com/MikkelGodsk/dtu_mlops_exam_project.git
cd dtu_mlops_exam_project
conda create -n myenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
dvc pull
python setup.py install
```


#####################################################

We used 
(mini)conda, 
pipreqs, 
docker, and 
git to manage our dependencies. We created a conda environment to make sure that the dependencies of our project do not cross-contaminate with others. Requirements of both pip and conda were handled by package pipreqs. To get a complete copy of our development environment, one would have to build our docker file:

docker build -f Docker.dockerfile . -t trainer:latest.

This file contains requirements.txt and environment.yml (generated wrespectively with commands pipreqs and conda env export > environment.yml). Finally, version control was managed with Git. A new team member would be invited to join the github repository, clone it, and run the docker file.










### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
> Answer:

The overall structure is initialized with the cookiecutter template. In general we tried to follow the cookiecutter structure as much as possible.


Since the original WMT19 dataset took up too much memory in both cloud and drive, we processed the data locally and only included a subset in the proccessed folder in the data folder. 

Thus we deleted the data/external/, data/interim/ and data/raw/ folders. We also deleted the folders notebooks/, references/, src/features/, src/visualization/, since we did not use these. We filled out the src/data/ folder and the src/models/ folder in which we also included a file src/models/evaluate_model.py for evaluating the model and a folder src/models/config/, with the configuration files.
We also included the tests/ folder which holds scripts for conducting different pytests.

#############


We used cookiecutter to create a template for our project. We mostly used it as a starting point for the creation of the project in order to have a more organized project.

The project folder contains any configuration files necessary for the project, such as settings for a specific framework or environment. The data folder is used to store any data related to the project, such as training and validation data and make_dataset.py file.

The models folder is used to store our imported model. The reports folder is used to store any reports generated by the project, such as performance metrics or analysis results. The src folder contains the source code for the project, including the training script under models/train_model.py

The test folder is used to store any test cases and test scripts used to test the project. The test folder includes subfolders for unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests.

From the original template we removed the LICENSE file, the notebooks, and references folders as not of interest to our project. We added the config folder.









### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these**
> **concepts matters in larger projects.**

Our code is formatted to meet Pep8 standards via black editor. 

Import statements are taken care of with isort. 

Rules for code and quality format are important as they ensure consistency, maintainability, and readability in large projects. This improves collaboration and reduces errors, ultimately saving time and resources.


############


In this project we have used typing and written comments when the code is not completly self explanatory, in addition to function docstrings. 

We tried to ensure that the code is pep8 compliant. 

To obtain this we have used black to format the code and flake8 to check. Lastly, we used isort to sort our imports. The code quality and format is tested in github actions, hence constantly ensuring the quality. 

Using these methods makes it much easier to share code and ensures the readability.












## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.




### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement?**
>
> Answer:

7













### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**


> **Answer length: 100-200 words.**
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

No, having a code coverage of 100% does not guarantee that the code is error-free. Code coverage measures the percentage of code that is executed during testing, but it does not take into account the quality of the tests or the correctness of the code logic. Even if all lines of code are executed, there may still be bugs or errors present in the code. 

Additionally, code coverage does not account for edge cases or unexpected inputs that may cause the code to fail. Therefore, it is important to also conduct thorough testing and code review to ensure the overall quality and reliability of the code. 



We have 100% code coverage on the prediction model (predict_model.py) and the API (main.py). We also have the TIMM training script and modules, but since we did not create those, we do not have tests for them.



###################

The total code coverage of code is 93%, which includes all our source code.
| Name                          | STMTS | Miss | Cover | Missing        |
|-------------------------------|-------|------|-------|----------------|
| ./src/\_\_init\_\_.py         | 0     | 0    | 100%  | -              |
| ./src/models/\_\_init\_\_.py  | 2     | 0    | 100%  | -              |
| ./src/models/model.py         | 48    | 4    | 92%   | 45, 47, 49, 51 |
| ./src/models/predict_model.py | 21    | 7    | 67%   | 21, 29-37      |
| ./tests/\_\_init\_\_.py       | 5     | 0    | 100%  | -              |
| ./tests/test_api.py           | 11    | 0    | 100%  | -              |
| ./tests/test_dataset.py       | 18    | 0    | 100%  | -              |
| ./tests/test_model.py         | 43    | 0    | 100%  | -              |
| TOTAL                         | 148   | 11   | 93%   | -              |

The reason for the code coverage less than 100% in the file `model.py` is that we deemed some of the checks in the constructor (`__init__`) too trivial to test. These are just checking for the data type and non-negativity of learning-rate and batch size.

In `predict_model.py`, the reason for the coverage being less than 100% is that we do not test with loading in a checkpoint. Unless we transfered this to GitHub, it would not be able to run in actions. Lastly, we have tested the code run in the `if __name__ == '__main__':`-block. In order to do so we had to open a pipe to another cmd using `os.popen` doing so, so the code is simply not counted here.












### Question 9

> **Did your workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had a branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:
We added branch protection on the main branch.
>
> Hence we created a feature branch where changes were made. We then used pull requests to merge with the main branch quite often. A pull request typically only concerned a few changes in a limited amount of scripts. Hence we avoided having an unmanageable amount of branches as well as reduced the number of merge conflicts. Before merging a branch with the main branch the tests are conducted to ensure that the merge will result in a working code. Furthermore when making major changes we assured that pull request were created and reviewed immediately.


#########

We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. 

For each feature or change we created a new branch. Each branch worked on different tasks: 

on one we created a dedicated environment for the project to 
   + keep track of packages, 
   + filled out the requirements.txt file, 
   + checked code formatting, 
   + setup version control, 
   + wrote one configuration file for our experiments, 
   + created a data storage in GCP Bucket for our data and 
   + linked this with our data version control setup. 

On another one we used Weights & Biases to log training progress and other important metrics/artifacts in our code; 

another one was used to write unit tests related to the data part of our code, to model construction and or model training, calculate the coverage 

and finally another to create a FastAPI application that can do inference using our model, and create a trigger workflow for automatically building our docker images.










### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
> Hint: Start out small! We recommend that you start out with less than 1GB of data. If the dataset you want to work with is larger, then subsample it. You can use dvc to version control your data and only download the full dataset when you are ready to train the model.

Be aware of many smaller files. DVC does not handle many small files well, and can take a long time to download. If you have many small files, consider zipping them together and then unzip them at runtime.

You do not need to use DVC for everything regarding data. You workflow is to just use DVC for version controlling the data, but when you need to get it you can just download it from the source. For example if you are storing your data in a GCP bucket, you can use the gsutil command to download the data or directly accessing the it using the cloud storage file system

Setup version control for your data or part of your data (M8)
Add pre-commit hooks to your version control setup (M18)
Create a data storage in GCP Bucket for your data and link this with your data version control setup (M21)

> Answer:

The wmt19 dataset originally contained around 9GB of data. 

Hence we decided to create a subset of the dataset. Data version control hereby contributed to an easy update of the data. 

We initially created a bucket in Google Cloud and used dvc to manage this. 

However s194333 did not have enough credit to sustain this service hence we had to create another bucket containing the same data with a different billing account. However we also stored the data on google drive, in case we potentially would use all credits on cloud again. Hence the dvc package proved to be very usefull for switching between different data storage options. In addition, dvc was an easy update to implement on all our devices since it only required some simple terminal commands.


################




Yes, initially Google Drive, then GCP bucket, and finally Git Large File System. Although we set up data version control, our dataset was never modified. In general, DVC is beneficial in managing data in a project when multiple team members are working on the same data set. With data version control, team members can collaborate on the dataset and make changes without interfering with each other's work. It also allows for easy tracking of changes and rollbacks if necessary. Additionally, data version control makes it easy to reproduce results and maintain a clear history of changes to the data set, which is essential for transparency and reproducibility in research projects. Overall, data version control ensures efficient collaboration and accountability in data management.


























### Question 11

> **Discuss your continuous integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test**
> **multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of**
> **your github actions workflow.**
>
> Answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing and one for running*
> *... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

We have organized our continues integration into three separate files: 
one for doing unittesting, 
one for running isort testing and 
one for running flake8. 


The isort test and the flake8 test are only run on the Ubuntu operating system and the python version 3.8. 

The unittesting is also run on the windows operating system and python version 3.10. 

Here we also make use of caching to speed up the process. Testing the dataset consists of loading the data and checking whether the format is correct. More precicely we check if the data (en-de) is given as a string and a label. When testing the model the following things must be satisfied
- The model is in torch
- The model outputs the translated sentence as a list containing a string
- In both training, validation and test the model outputs a torch tensor containing a float (not NaN)

https://github.com/MikkelGodsk/dtu_mlops_exam_project/actions/runs/3961726045/workflow



#######################################



To control the testing and deploying we used git workflow. The test suite that we use consists of validation testing and unit testing. We use two git hub triggers, one for pull request on the main, which runs the validation test and unit test suite, and one for pushing/merging to main, which runs  the build and deployment suite after having passed all tests. The tests suite tests various versions of python, but only on linux(ubuntu) which the docker container is built on.

The validation tests consist of checking if the newest module gives the correct inference on some custom data. We also verify the data used to train the model, by checking if the format of the training data is correct. 

The unit testing consists of testing the front end api, to ensure excellent user experience.


Overall, our use of git workflow and a comprehensive test suite allowed us to efficiently and effectively test and deploy our project, ensuring the highest quality for our users.

The workflows can be found here:

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.








### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run an experiment.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: python my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

When training the model the hyperparameters are by default loaded from the configuration file src/models/config/default_params.yaml. It is also possible to pass a different path using the argparser. The configuration file contains the learning rate, number of epochs, the batch size of the model and a seed if reproducability is desired. The configuration file is passed to the wandb.init() function and the hyperparameters are loaded into the training script with the following code:

lr = wandb.config.lr
epochs = wandb.config.epochs
batch_size = wandb.config.batch_size

We utilized the *sweep* functionality of `wandb` in an attempt to optimize hyperparamters. Through `wandb` the hyperparameter configuration was logged. The hyperparameters for the different experiments are then set to the hyperparameters resulting in the best validation loss.

When using the src/models/predict_model.py we use a simple argparser to give the input string to be translated along with the checkpoint file containing the trained model weights.

###

As a first apporoach, we used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way:

python train.py --lr 1e-4 --batch_size 50 --seed 1337.

Hyperparameters were stored under config/config.yaml. 

In general, a configuration file contains desired experiment settings, such as hyperparameters, data paths, and run options. 

A developer uses a library or script to read the file and set the corresponding values in the code before running the experiment. 

Further on, we built and run several images locally, varying the initialisation of the LR.

















### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:
When we load the config file the hyperparameters of the model is set to the values provided in the file.
>
> Hence one can easily see which parameters are used to train.
>
> However, when conducting experiments it is important to track which parameters are used. By ensuring commits between changes in config file we make sure that experiments are logged in the git commit history.
>
> In order to reproduce the experiments we included a seed in the configuration file. Hereby we ensure that the exact same results are obtained when training a model with a specific set of hyperparameters. Furthermore we created docker images, which ensures that our models can be run on all computers. By running multiple experiments in W&B we ensure that hyperparameters are kept in W&B.



###

We made use of config files in our experiments. Whenever we ran an experiment, several metrics were logged to W&B, as shown in the images below. 

The graphs demonstrate that the val and train loss reduce over time. To reproduce an experiment, one would need to select the desired set of hyperparameters from the config/name_of_the_experiment file. 

In this file, all the hyperparameters are listed, which made the training deterministic. These include the batch size, learning rate, seed split, seed train, image size, and train-val split. Having all these hyperparameters listed in one place allowed us to easily reproduce our experiments and ensure consistency in our results. It also allowed us to easily compare different sets of hyperparameters and determine which ones were the most effective for our particular problem. Overall, the use of config files was a crucial aspect of our experimentation process and helped us to achieve more accurate and reliable results.

















### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**
> **inspiration from [this figure](figures/wandb.png). Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are**
> **important.**
>
> Answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.
>
> Example:
> *As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.*
> *As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...*
>
> Answer:

In W&B we track the training loss as seen on the figure below.

![Training loss](figures/train_loss.png)

We see a small descrease of the loss. This metric is essential for showing whether the model is learning from the data during the training.

We also track the validation loss as seen on the figure below.

![Validation loss](figures/val_loss.png)

The validation loss is very important to monitor the models performance when presented to unknown data.

We also perform a sweep in an attempt to optimize hyperparamters based on obtaining the lowest possible validation loss.

![Sweep hyperparameters](figures/hyperparams.png)

This did however show us that with the best hyperparameterse the validation loss remains constant.

#####################

![timma1_exp](figures/timma1_exp.png)
![timmh_exp](figures/timmh_exp.png)

We utilized loss and accuracy as metrics in W&B to monitor the performance of our machine learning models. Loss is a measure of how well a model is able to predict the target variable, and it is calculated by comparing the predicted values to the actual values. In other words, it represents the error of the model, and the goal is to minimize it. In contrast, accuracy is a measure of how well the model is able to correctly classify the target variable. It is calculated by comparing the number of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances.

During the training process, we used W&B to track and visualize the evolution of these metrics. This helped us to identify when the model was overfitting or underfitting, and to make adjustments accordingly. By monitoring the loss and accuracy, we were able to optimize the model's performance and fine-tune the parameters to achieve the best results.

We also compared the performance of different models by comparing the metrics in W&B. For example, as can be seen from the images above, in timma1_exp the eval_top1 reaches 87.5% accuracy, whereas timmh_exp reached eval_top1 99.3% accuracy. This allowed us to determine which model performed better (we are currently deployin a model that reached 99.7% accuracy at test time) and to make decisions on which model to use for further analysis.



















### Question 15

> **Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your**
> **experiments? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the*
> *training docker image: `docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64`. Link to docker file: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

In our project, reproducablity is very important, hence we utilize Docker in order to ensure that the application can be run on all devices. Hence we created docker images for training and deploying the model. 

Since building docker images are a time consuming task, we prefred google cloud for building the dockerimages in cloud using a dockerfile and triggers. 

After being build the docker images are run using google cloud Run.


A link to the training docker file is provided in the following:
https://github.com/MikkelGodsk/dtu_mlops_exam_project/blob/main/trainer.dockerfile



############################################

In the training phase, Docker is used to create a containerized environment for the training dataset and the training script. This ensures that the training process is consistent and reproducible across different environments. 

In the inference phase, a containerized environment is created for the trained model and the inference script, which can be deployed to different environments. 

In the deployment phase, the containerized environment is deployed to a production environment, such as a cloud service or a local server, to ensure that the model is running in a consistent environment. This allows for easy scaling and management of the deployed model.

### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>
> Answer:

When locally executing code we used the build in debugger in visual studio code and when this was not enough we used simple print statements. 

The debugging mode in visual studio is in general quite informative and helpfull when erros occured. 

When for example building images in google cloud a lot of errors occured. 

Hence debugging needed to be performed locally before building in cloud.




We used the inbuild tool from pytorch lightning for profiling the training, but we did not really do anything to improve the code based on the profilling. 


However we are aware that the code might be edible for improvements. For example, we considered saving the tokenized dataset, which would probably speed up the training processes, such that the tokenisation is not necessary every time the training function is called.



########################################


When running into bugs while trying to run experiments, we first tried to identify the source of the problem by reviewing the code and any error messages that are displayed. 

Next, we used the TIMM documentation to understand why the trainig was failing. We also made sure to test small sections of the code at a time to ensure that the problem was not caused by an interaction between multiple sections. 


Additionally, we consulted online resources to see if similar bugs have been reported and if there were any known solutions. 



We did not perform any profiling of our main code.

















## Working in the cloud

> In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.


### Question 17

> **List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?**
>
> Answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

Google Cloud Platform's Engine and Bucket are two separate services that work together to provide a comprehensive solution for cloud computing and storage. 


Engine is a powerful and flexible platform that allows users to create and run virtual machines, containers, and other applications on the cloud. It provides a wide range of features and tools for managing and scaling resources, including automatic load balancing, automatic backups, and automatic scaling. This makes it easy for users to create and manage their applications and services on the cloud, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

Buckets:
Bucket is a cloud-based storage service that allows users to store and manage data in the cloud. It provides a simple and cost-effective way to store and access data, including large files, images, videos, and other types of data. Bucket also provides a range of security and access controls, so users can control who has access to their data and how it is used. We used GCP buckets for initally storing the data. However we quickly ran out of credits and hence had to create a new bucket containg the same data but with a different billing account. Furthermore we also used buckets for storring checkpoints. 

Together, Engine and Bucket provide a powerful and reliable solution for cloud computing and storage, making it easy for users to create and manage their applications and services on the cloud.

> Answer:

Deploying the model locally was quite straight forward. Inputs to the model can easily be given through the terminal. 


However deploying in google cloud caused a lot more complication. For deployment we wrapped our model into an application using FastAPI and used cloud run. We were heavily challenged by the fact that after training the model the checkpoint could not be saved to a bucket on cloud without authentication, which we did not manage to implement. Hence we did not use the finetuned model for deployment directly trough cloud.

We did however manage to finetune the model on the hypatia cluster at DTU and uploading a checkpoint to bucket, however we had issues with downloading he checkpoint from within the python code (again due to authentication issues). 


Given a little more time, it would have been easy to setup DVC such that the model weights would be store alongside the dataset, whence we should have been able to get the finetuned model to deploy.

In the training file, we used distributed data loading and multiple workers implemented through pytorch-lightning.

###############################

We successfully deployed our model in the cloud using Google Cloud Platform's Cloud Run service. We wrapped our model into an application and made it accessible to users via a specific URL. It can be accessed via <https://riceclassifier-375010-zhexeh6bxa-uc.a.run.app/> . User is required to load a 224x224, black and white image in jpg format of a grain of rice among Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag rice varieties for recognition.

It can also be accessed using `curl -X POST -F "file=@file.json" <  11:05 AM

### Question 23

> **Did you manage to implement monitoring of your deployed model? If yes, explain how it works. If not, explain how**
> **monitoring would help the longevity of your application.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did not manage to implement monitoring. We would like to have monitoring implemented such that over time we could*
> *measure ... and ... that would inform us about this ... behaviour of our application.*
>
> Answer:

We did not manage to implement monitoring. We would like to have monitoring implemented such that over time we could measure translation accuracy (based e.g on user rating) that would inform us about the performance and hence usefullness of our model. 

Provided we modelled the german and english language perfectly, our model would be quite prone to data-drifting. 

The only real issue would be words having new meanings or new words being adapted to the languages. 


However, this *perfect* modelling is rarely the case in real life as the dataset for a given translation task, will ultimately only be a subset of the distribution modelling the language. 

This means that our model will be context dependent. 

A weakness derived from this could e.g. be if the training dataset was exceedingly formal and we received an input which was very informal. As such, monitoring a user-based translation accuracy score could inform when our model becomes outdated.




################################################

![monitoring](figures/monitoring.png)

We monitored our model in terms of 
   application errors, 
   billing,
   memory usage, and 
   uptime check uptime failure. 

This allowed us to keep track of any issues that may have arisen during the operation of our application. By monitoring for errors, we were able to quickly identify and fix any bugs that were causing the application to malfunction. 

We also monitored billing to ensure that we were not incurring any unnecessary costs. Keeping an eye on memory usage helped us optimize the performance of our model, and uptime checks allowed us to detect and fix any issues that were causing the application to go down.

By monitoring our model in these ways, we were able to ensure the longevity of our application. By catching and fixing errors early on, we were able to prevent them from causing more significant problems down the line.

s194333 did not use any credit for this project, since she managed to use all her credit on the project created for M21. In total on this project together we used around 5 dollars. Google cloud was not very transparent about billing account or money usage.




In total, 2 credits at the time of writing were spend during development. The most expensive service was github LFS which had "significant" bandwidth costs.

>
> Answer:

![Graphical reprsentation of architecture](figures/graphical_representation_of_architecture.png)
The starting point of the diagram is our local pytorch application, which we wrapped in the **pytorch lightning** framework. 

This served as the inital steps of creating the mlops pipeline. We version-controled our project using **git** via **Github**. 


A new environment can be initialized using either **Conda** or **pip**. We opted to use `pipreqs` for finding the package requirements of our project, which made for seamless instantiation of the projects *requirements.txt*. We utilized `wandb` in conjunction with **pytorch lightning** for logging the 'experiments'/ training of our *NLP* model. For training configuration `wandb` performed satisfactory, hence `hydra` was omited from this project. These are the essential parts which are contained into a **docker** container. Locally the project follows the codestructure of **Cookiecutter**.

In order to utilize the **GPC** git and dvc both provides a link from the local machine. Git furthermore enabled **Github actions** for testing the code before uploading to a remote storage. Using a **trigger** connected to the github repository we created **docker images** in **docker containers** in the cloud.

When training a dataset stored in a **GCP bucket** was utilized. Information sharing and version control of the dataset was handled by utilizing **dvc**. We interfaced with our application through **Cloud Run** by using the **Fast API** framework. Finally, we didn't utilize monitoring as we had plenty of work on our hands, trying to interface with and getting our model to run on cloud.

![overview](figures/overview.jpg)

We, as a team, used GitHub Actions to run multiple tests on our code every time we committed and pushed it to GitHub. This included using tools such as CodeCov to measure code coverage. If all tests passed, we then integrated the code into our single docker image and pushed it to the Google Container Registry. This registry allowed us to easily access, download, and use pre-built images for our applications, as well as upload and share our own images with others.
We also used GitHub Actions to push the deployment version to Google Cloud Platform's Cloud Run. This allowed us to deploy our containerized, stateless HTTP-based service in a highly scalable and cost-effective manner. Users were able to upload images on our API interface and the query would return the label and accuracy of the prediction. We made sure that all source code was available on GitHub for users to clone. Additionally, we utilized the Weights and Biases (W&B) tool for tracking, analyzing, and visualizing our experiments. We ran experiments on our local machines and chose the best set of parameters for deployment.
















### Question 26

> **Discuss the overall struggles of the project. Where did you spend most time and what did you do to overcome these**
> **challenges?**
>
> Answer length: 200-400 words.
>
> Example:
> *The biggest challenges in the project was using ... tool to do ... . The reason for this was ...*
>
> Answer:

Our first time consuming task was to download the data. 

This was downloaded from huggingface which took a long time. 

We also spent an excessive amount of time trying to train our model on cloud. Some main factors contributing to this issue, was our funding running short and having to authenticate multiple frameworks within a docker container. s194333 created the project on GCP, however she quickly (within 48 hours) ran short on funding (complementary of the course) due to operations ineracting with the *bucket* storing our data. 


We aren't entirely certain as to what depleted the grants, however this greatly restricted our work. 

From docker we needed to authenticate dvc, GCP, in addition to `wandb`. This proved tremendously cumbersome as the authentication requires certfication, which we would preferably avoid storing in the docker image. 


During this process we spent a lot of time debugging. Due to long building times errors didn't occur immediatly, which resulted in a lot of reapeated idle time.

In general most of the tools and frameworks were relativly new for us, which resulted in a lot of google searches and unknown errors. The exercises significantly prepared us for conducting the project, however we still had a lot to learn when making the project. This challenged us in many ways, however we ultimately managed to overcome these.



##################

One of the main struggles our team faced during the project was managing multiple branches on our git repository. 

As we progressed through the project, we encountered multiple challenges that required us to create new branches to fix bugs or implement new features. 

However, this led to confusion and difficulty in merging the branches back into the main branch. To overcome this challenge, we implemented a strict branching strategy where we designated specific team members as branch managers to ensure that merging was done in an organised and timely manner.

Another struggle we faced was installing the necessary tools for the project. The project required us to use several new technologies that we were not familiar with, such as GCP and Weights & Biases. This led to a significant amount of time spent on researching and learning how to use these tools effectively.

Integrating our model into the cookie cutter structure was another challenge we faced. The cookie cutter structure provided a clear and organized file structure for the project, but it was difficult for us to understand how to properly integrate our model into it. This led to a lot of time spent on understanding the structure and determining the best way to integrate our model. To overcome this challenge, we discussed regularly to brainstorm solutions.
